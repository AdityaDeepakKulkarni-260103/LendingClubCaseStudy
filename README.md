## General Information
- This project is a data analysis project that aims to analyze a loan dataset to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between various features and the loan status.

- The dataset used in this project is a loan dataset, which contains information about various loans, including the loan amount, interest rate, installment, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, and loan status.

- The business problem that this project is trying to solve is to identify the factors that contribute to a loan being charged off or fully paid.

## Conclusions
- The analysis reveals that there are significant differences in the means of numerical features between charged off and fully paid loans
- The distribution of annual income and debt-to-income ratio for charged off and fully paid loans are different.
- There is a positive correlation between loan amount and installment amount.
- The interest rate and debt-to-income ratio are highly correlated.


## Technologies Used
